'''
/ → Division (True Division)

What it does
Divides two numbers
ALWAYS returns a float
Keeps the decimal part

📌 Rule to remember

/ = normal mathematical division → output is always decimal
'''

print("Division:", a / b)

'''
// → Floor Division

What it does
Divides two numbers
Removes the decimal part
Returns the quotient only

📌 Rule to remember

// = how many full times b fits into a (floor value)
'''
print("Floor Division:", a // b)

'''
% → Modulus (Remainder)

What it does

Returns the remainder after division

📌 Rule to remember

% = what’s left after dividing
'''
