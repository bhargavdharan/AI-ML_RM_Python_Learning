# 🧾 Personal Info & Salary Report (Python Basics Mini Project)




## 🎯 Objective

This mini project is designed to practice Python basics:
- Variables
- Data types
- Type casting
- Arithmetic operators
- Input and output

No control flow (if/else, loops) is used in this project.

The program collects personal information from the user and
generates a simple summary report with some calculated values.

## 🧠 Features

The program will:

1. Ask the user for:
   - Name (string)
   - Age in years (integer)
   - City (string)
   - Monthly salary (float)
   - Savings percentage (integer)

2. Calculate:
   - Age in months
   - Age in approximate days (age * 365)
   - Annual salary (monthly * 12)
   - Estimated yearly tax (fixed 10% of annual salary)
   - Monthly savings amount based on savings percentage

3. Print a formatted summary report.
